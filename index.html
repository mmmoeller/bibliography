          <h2>Writer + Editor</h2>

          
            <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16" src="https://madilynmoeller.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/mmm-logo.png" alt="MMM logo" width="200" height="200" />
            <h2>BIOGRAPHICALLY</h2>
            <p>After naturally excelling in English, the critical cues were the tears of awe in understanding the symbolic purpose of minute details in a cereal ad. Each detail, color, font, and placement had a purpose and was a conscious symbolic decision. My appreciation for marketing grew and I knew that my skills could be useful in a variety of fields.</p>
            
            <p>Freshman year of college, I went in as a Professional Writing major, in the Editing track. Four years later, I am graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, with a Neuroscience Co-Major, in addition to the Bachelor of Arts in Professional Writing.</p>
            
            <p>Why neuroscience? Biological psychology is fascinating and there is so much more to be discovered. Entering this major, it was an aspiration of mine to enter into research to lessen the detrimental effects of dementia. I had the opportunity to participate in behavioral neuroscience lab studies, which will later be expanded upon by the primary investigator to inform our understanding of Dopamine's impact on cognitive abilities.</p>
            <h3>MUSICALLY</h3>
            <p>After I tried the clarinet and oboe, the music teacher handed me a flute. Not a sound came out. She told me I was a flute, whether for numbers or because of my proportionally-long arms, I do not know. I am thankful for that decision putting me in the band community, where I made lifelong friendships bonding over "dance elements" which included lying on the parking lot in July.</p>
            
            <p>Going to a university out of state, I decided to join the marching band. Through the experience of run-ons and rain delays, we became a family. I went on to watch my first hockey games playing in the pep band, which also brought energy to the volleyball and basketball audiences. Years from now, I hope I can still play the fight song from memory.</p>
            
            <p>Music is still a part of me now that I am not in an ensemble. It never ceases to brighten the mood of the house. Silence is overrated when you could instead listen to feel-good music and boost your endorphins.</p>
            <h3>LAWFUL GOOD Approach to Grammar</h3>
            <p>Noted pragmatist, I asked for <i>Dreyer's English</i> for my 21st birthday. <br />
            <br />
            I have worked as a writing consultant for two years. We work on written works from all academic disciplines to address a writer's needs while teaching them to recognize patterns for future writing.</p>
            <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
            <p>Myers-Briggs classifies me as ISFJ. I care deeply, pouring my heart into purposeful work. Always thought of myself as a combination of Ravenclaw and Slytherin. However, my Hufflepuff friend declares themself Slytherin, so I believe we judge ourselves as we would like to be seen, not as we are. I prefer to think of myself as lawful good.</p>
            <h4>What informs my personality?</h4>
            <p>Without a doubt, my college experience has molded me into the person I am today. I became an advocate of teamwork, a dependable communicator, a loyal friend and family member. My band sorority provided service for the band, which was exactly the community of multi-faceted people I was honored to know. My role models became my friends and family members.</p>
            <h3>IN SUM</h3>
           <p> I am a triple major college graduate. My closest friends share a mutual interest in the art of music and the aesthetic qualities it projects to others. I have served as a writing consultant for two years at my university, a job that I love. I hope to continue writing and editing with purpose. Ideally, I will find an opportunity to share my English- and science-tailored writing and research skills with a thoughtful company.</p>

            <h3>Professional Writing</h3>
            <p>Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven writing, critical thinking, and research skills. Experience in my professional courses has given me tools in Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop, and in my final semester I worked with HTML and CSS to produce an ebook version of The Scarlet Letter. I also have experience writing grant proposals both for research endeavors and to secure funding for projects. Some of the most enduring work I’ve contributed to includes marketing materials for Louie’s Legacy Animal Rescue and an informational brochure and website for the Historic Hopewell Church.</p>
